Mustang



When Ford first released the sleek, high-performance Mustang 1964, 
it was a success from the get-go. Over forty years later, still 
fast, classy, and relatively inexpensive, the Mustang continues 
to boast a devoted following. Featuring iconic models from different 
eras in the Mustang’s glorious history, this mini wall calendar puts you in 
the driver’s seat and sets you free on the open road.
