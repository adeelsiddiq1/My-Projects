Owls


As nocturnal birds of prey, owls are blessed with exceptional 
vision and the best hearing of all birds. These gifts enable them 
to dwell in dense forested areas. The owl is associated with wisdom,
 perhaps because of its fixed gaze, which makes it appear as if it is 
in deep thought. Take your time—take all the time you want—to study 
the mesmerizing owls in this mini wall calendar.
